The goal is to precompute a data structure that, given any output h of the hash function, can either locate an element p in P such that H(p) = h, or determine that there is no such p in P. The simplest way to do this is compute H(p) for all p in P, but then storing the table requires Θ(|P|n) bits of space, where |P| is the size of the set P and n is the size of an output of H, which is prohibitive for large</p>
